### **Problem Statement**

AI-generated code (e.g., via tools like GitHub Copilot, Codex, or LLMs) faces challenges in reliability due to hallucinations and opaque reasoning. While automated tests (e.g., unit tests) are proposed to validate correctness, they are limited to predefined scenarios and may miss edge cases. Meanwhile, evaluating AI-generated outputs often relies on human input, creating scalability and bias challenges. This raises critical questions:

- Can black-box testing frameworks _and_ data-driven methods reduce reliance on human intervention without sacrificing code quality?
- How can we empirically measure the trade-offs between automation and human oversight in AI-code collaboration?

### **Gaps**

1. Most studies focus on **either** automated testing **or** human evaluation, but few explore hybrid workflows.
2. Limited empirical work on **data mining patterns in AI-generated code defects** (e.g., using code complexity metrics for defect prediction).
3. Few papers quantify the **minimum human input** required for reliable AI-generated code.

### **Research Questions**

1. **Validation of AI-Generated Code**

   - Can automated tests (e.g., unit, integration, or adversarial tests) reliably detect errors in AI-generated code compared to human-reviewed code?
   - What types of errors (syntax, logic, security) are most/least likely to be caught by automated tests vs. humans?

2. **AI Evaluation Without Human Input**

   - Can data mining (e.g., code complexity metrics, historical defect rates) predict the reliability of AI-generated code?
   - Are there patterns in AI-generated code (e.g., repetition, dependency chains) that correlate with defects?

3. **Human-Machine Collaboration**
   - What is the minimum viable human input required to ensure code correctness in AI-generated outputs?
   - How do hybrid workflows (e.g., AI drafts code → automated tests flag issues → humans review flagged cases) perform compared to fully manual or fully automated processes?

### **Goals**

1. Develop a framework for evaluating AI-generated code using **automated tests** and **data-driven metrics** (e.g., code complexity, dependency analysis).
2. Quantify the effectiveness of human input in AI-code validation and propose strategies to minimize its necessity.
3. Propose a scalable model for human-AI collaboration in software development, supported by empirical evidence.

### **Methodology: Empirical Study with Data Mining**

#### **Data Collection**

- **Dataset**: Gather AI-generated code samples (e.g., from GitHub Copilot, GPT-4, or open-source repositories like CodeSearchNet).
- **Comparison Baseline**: Human-written code for similar tasks (e.g., from GitHub).
- **Annotations**: Label code samples with defects (via automated tools like linters, static analyzers, and manual human review).

#### **Experiments**

1. **Automated Testing Effectiveness**

   - Run black-box tests (unit, integration, fuzz tests) on AI-generated vs. human code.
   - Compare failure rates and defect types using statistical analysis (e.g., chi-square, ANOVA).

2. **Data Mining for Defect Prediction**

   - Extract features from code (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, dependency depth, token repetition, API usage patterns).
   - Train ML models (e.g., decision trees, SVMs) to predict defects using these features.
   - Compare model accuracy against human evaluation results.

3. **Human Input Reduction Analysis**
   - Simulate workflows with varying levels of human involvement (e.g., 100% automated → hybrid → 100% human).
   - Measure time, cost, and accuracy trade-offs using metrics like F1-score, precision/recall, and defect escape rate.

#### **Tools**

- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, SonarQube.
- **Testing Frameworks**: PyTest, JUnit, Hypothesis (for fuzz testing).
- **Data Mining**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn), NLP libraries (e.g., for code tokenization).

### **Potential Themes to Explore**

1. **The Illusion of Correctness**: How often does AI-generated code pass tests but fail in production (e.g., security vulnerabilities, race conditions)?
2. **Bias in Automation**: Do automated tests favor certain coding styles (e.g., verbose vs. terse) or languages?
3. **Economic Implications**: Cost-benefit analysis of human-in-the-loop workflows vs. fully automated pipelines.

### **Contribution to Knowledge**

- Empirical evidence on the limitations of automated tests for AI-generated code.
- A data-driven model to prioritize human review for high-risk AI outputs.
